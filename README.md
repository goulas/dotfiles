# dotfiles

This repository contains my dot files and some automation to work with the [dotfiles](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles) tool.



Script ``install.sh`` asks the appropriate questions in order to setup a new machine.

Script ``refresh.sh`` pulls the latest version and fixes repository directory before synchronizing.
